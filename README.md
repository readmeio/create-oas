## Installation/Usage

You can run this module using any of the following methods:

```sh
npm create oas
npm init oas
npx create-oas
```

This will lead you through a series of questions that will prompt you to create a base OAS file (in either JSON or YAML format).

You can add [paths](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#paths-object) to your OAS spec either directly in this file, or in in your code using something like [swagger-inline](https://github.com/readmeio/swagger-inline) or [fastify-swagger](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-swagger).
